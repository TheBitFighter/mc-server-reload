# HotReload
This is HotReload. It is a simple plugin that enables reloading a Minecraft server through a restful API.\
That's about it.

## But why?
It allows for continuous deployment of plugin builds through task integration im Gradle.\
I wanted to develop a Bukkit plugin and continuously test versions without having to fumble with the server console.

## Can I haz?
